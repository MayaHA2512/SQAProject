## Contributions

This project was completed individually by [Your Name]. All aspects of the application, including feature implementation, testing, security enhancements, and CI/CD setup, were handled independently.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Only the author can edit or delete their own posts.


<h2 id="challenges-and-solutions">Challenges and Solutions</h2>

Throughout the development process, I faced a few key challenges that required careful consideration and problem-solving.

## User Authentication and Authorization:

1. - Challenge: Implementing secure user authentication was a critical requirement. Ensuring that passwords were stored securely and users could only access and modify their own posts posed a challenge.
   - Solution: I used Fernet encryption for securely hashing user passwords, ensuring they were stored in an encrypted format in the database. For authorization, I implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict post-editing and deletion to the respective authors only.
  
2. - Challenge: Comprehensive testing, especially for edge cases, was a challenge because it required thinking about potential user behavior and error scenarios. Writing tests for scenarios like invalid logins and incorrect post submissions needed careful consideration.
   - Solution: I wrote a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests, ensuring edge cases were tested (e.g., invalid user credentials or unauthorized post modifications). This helped achieve high code coverage and ensure the applicationâ€™s stability.

**User Authentication**

User Authentication (Login & Registration)

The authentication system allows users to register, log in, and access blog posts. Here's an overview of how the authentication flow works:

1. User Registration:
   Users can create a new account by providing a username and password.
   The password is securely encrypted using Fernet encryption before being stored in the database. This           ensures that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain safe.

   Code Implementation:
   In the registration route (/register), the application accepts a POST request where the user's username and    password are submitted. We do a check to ensure that the username doesn't already exist in the database
   The password is then encrypted using the encrypt_password method:
   encrypted_password = self.encrypt_password(password)
   The encrypted password is stored in the database under the Author model.

   ![Untitled4535](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60f2746f-05f5-45eb-9b66-401d87a692cc)

   but if the account already exists:

   Code Snippet:
   ```python

   @self.app.route("/register", methods=["GET", "POST"])
        def register():
            if request.method == "POST":
                username = request.form["username"]
                password = request.form["password"]

                # Check if the username already exists in the database
                existing_author = Author.query.filter_by(name=username).first()
                if existing_author:
                    flash('Username already exists. Please choose a different one.', 'danger')
                    return render_template("register.html")

                # Encrypt the password before storing it
                encrypted_password = self.encrypt_password(password)

                # Create a new author and add to the database
                author = Author(name=username, password=encrypted_password)
                db.session.add(author)
                db.session.commit()

                # Redirect to login page after successful registration
                flash('Registration successful! You can now log in.', 'success')
                return render_template("login.html")

            return render_template("register.html")

   ````

2. User Login:
   Process Overview:
   - To login, users enter their username and password.
   - The entered password is decrypted and compared with the stored encrypted password.
   - If the credentials are correct, the user is granted access to the homepage and can see the posts.
   
   Code Implementation:
   - In the login route (/login), the application accepts the POST request and checks the credentials by calling the check_credentials method:
     ```python
     author = self.check_credentials(username, password)
     ```
   - Inside check_credentials, the provided password is decrypted using the decrypt_password method:
     ```python
     decrypted_password = self.decrypt_password(author.password)
     ```
   -  The login is successful if the decrypted password matches the entered password.

    @self.app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
           def login():
               if request.method == "POST":
                   username = request.form["username"]
                   password = request.form["password"]
                   author = self.check_credentials(username, password)
                   self.user = author
                   if author:
                       return render_template('index.html', posts=self.posts(), user=self.user)
                   else:
                       self.logger.info('User does not exist')
                       flash('Something went wrong: either username or password are incorrect', "danger")
                       return render_template("login.html")
               return render_template("login.html")
   
   ```

**Role Baaed Access control (RBAC)**

In this project, RBAC is implemented to control who can edit and delete posts.

- Authors can edit or delete only their posts.
- Readers (regular users) cannot edit or delete any posts.

You can see if I am logged in as 'mayaisalegend2', I cannot delete a post by testing1:

**Testing Evidence**

Testing Approach

For testing, I used pytest to write both unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correct functionality of role-based access control (RBAC) and user authentication.

Unit Tests: Focused on individual functions such as user authentication, role assignments, and permission checks.
Integration Tests: Tested end-to-end functionality of key features, including user login, post creation, editing, and deletion based on roles.
Test Files & Coverage

Unit Tests: Located in tests/test_models.py and tests/test_auth.py
Integration Tests: Located in tests/test_routes.py

Tests passing:

![TESTING2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e13d1c1a-5090-40ca-b0b9-880c77fbbcc7)

Testing Strategies
I followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, where tests were written before implementing the corresponding features. This helped ensure that each feature met the expected requirements before writing production code.

Example:
1. Wrote a test to check that authors can only edit their posts.
2. Implemented the feature in app.py.
3. Ran the test to verify the implementation.

Edge Cases & Error Handling
1. Testing Unauthorized Access:
   Tried editing/deleting posts as a reader (expected to be denied).
   Tried editing/deleting posts as an author but for another userâ€™s post (expected to be denied).
   
2. Testing Invalid Inputs:
   Attempted to register with an existing username (expected to show an error message).
   Tried submitting a post without a title/content (expected form validation error).

3. Testing Authentication Scenarios:
   Attempted to access a protected route without logging in (expected redirect to login page).

**Implemented Security Measures**

Password Encryption with Fernet

User passwords are encrypted before being stored using Fernet encryption from the cryptography library.
The encryption and decryption functions are in app.py:

```python

def encrypt_password(self, password):
    return self.fernet_suite.encrypt(bytes(password, 'utf-8'))

def decrypt_password(self, password):
    password = self.fernet_suite.decrypt(password)
    return password.decode('utf-8')

```

This ensures that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain unreadable.


**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Only the original author of a blog post can edit or delete it.
In edit_page and delete_action, the app checks if the logged-in user is the author before allowing modifications:

```python
if post in self.posts_by_user():
    return render_template("edit.html", post=post, user=self.user)
else:
    flash('You are attempting to edit a post that was created by another user', 'danger')
    return redirect(url_for("post", post_id=post.id))

```
This prevents unauthorized users from tampering with others' posts.

**Flash Message Input Validation**

When registering, the app checks if a username already exists and flashes an error message:

```python
existing_user = Author.query.filter_by(name=username).first()
if existing_user:
    flash("Username already exists. Please choose another.", "danger")
    return redirect(url_for("register"))

```

**seesion management**

Users must log in before creating, editing, or deleting posts. The app maintains session security by clearing self.user on logout:

Login (Note that we set self.user to the logged in user upon logout as part of session management):

```python
@self.app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
        def login():
            if request.method == "POST":
                username = request.form["username"]
                password = request.form["password"]
                author = self.check_credentials(username, password)
                self.user = author
                if author:
                    return render_template('index.html', posts=self.posts(), user=self.user)
                else:
                    self.logger.info('User does not exist')
                    flash('Something went wrong: either username or password are incorrect', "danger")
                    return render_template("login.html")
            return render_template("login.html")
```

logout (Note that we reset self.user to None upon logout as part of session management):

```python

 @self.app.route("/logout")
        def logout():
            self.user = None  # Clear the user object
            return redirect(url_for("login"))  # Redirect to homepage or login
```

## DB

The application uses Flask-SQLAlchemy to manage the database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. The primary entities in the system are Authors and BlogPosts, which maintain a one-to-many relationship.

Authors Table
Stores user credentials and author names.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE author (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL
);
```
BlogPosts Table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE blog_post (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    author_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES author(name) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Code Quality and Refactoring Evidence**

File Structure:

![file_organisation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4535e6c8-32c2-40e6-8ec3-1056d041ea63)

Code refactoring:
My check_credentials() method is doing a full table scan so I optimizeD with a direct query:

Before:
```python
    def check_credentials(self, username, password):
        authors = Author.query.all()
        author = [author for author in authors if author.name == username and self.decrypt_password(author.password) == password]
        if author:
            return author[0]
```

After:
```python
 def check_credentials(self, username, password):
        author = Author.query.filter_by(name=username).first()
        if author and self.decrypt_password(author.password) == password:
            return author
```

**CI/CD and Git Practices Evidence**

To ensure code quality and stability, GitHub Actions is used to automatically run tests and enforce best practices before merging any changes.

1. Automated Testing with GitHub Actions
2. Every pull request triggers a CI/CD pipeline that runs:
3. Unit tests using pytest
4. Linting using Pep8 to enforce coding standards
5. This ensures that only tested and properly formatted code is merged.
